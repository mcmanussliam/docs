# Examples

## Open with VS Code

This is one of the first actions I made, the amount of times I've had to open
an obsidian doc in either vim or vs code is incredibly annoying, especially since
my notes are incredibly nested.

```shell
/path/to/vs/code/code "{{{path}}}"
```

Keep in mind, you can't use aliases in plugins, you **must** use the paths, this
uses a simple plain shell.

## Compile Latex

Turns out there isn't that good of a market for local Latex Editors, I realised
it wouldn't be that hard to turn Obsidian into a nice Latex Editor.

This relies on another plugin, I've got my own [Obsidian Code View Plugin](https://github.com/mcmanussliam/obsidian-code-view),
this isn't released though, I know there's another [one that may offer the same functionality](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=vscode-editor).

```js
new Notice('compiling latex');

const COMPILE_SCRIPT = '/absolute/path/to/bash/script.sh';
const FILE_PATH = '{{{path}}}';

const PATH_PARTS = FILE_PATH.split('/');
const FILENAME = PATH_PARTS.pop();
const DIR = PATH_PARTS.join('/');

const response = exec(
  `cd "/${DIR}" && "${COMPILE_SCRIPT}" "./${FILENAME}"`,
  (err, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err, stderr);
      new Notice('dang it, failed');
      return;
    }

    console.log('fin', stdout);
    new Notice('successfully compiled');
  }
);
```

Then I've got this bash script which handles a lot of the logic:

```sh
set -e

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 /full/path/to/file.tex"
  exit 1
fi

FILEPATH="$1"
DIRECTORY="$(dirname "$FILEPATH")"
FILENAME="$(basename "$FILEPATH")"
FILENAMETEXT="${FILENAME%.*}"

export PATH="/path/to/tiny/tex"

cd "$DIRECTORY"

pdflatex --shell-escape -interaction=nonstopmode "$FILENAME"
bibtex "$FILENAMETEXT" || true
pdflatex --shell-escape -interaction=nonstopmode "$FILENAME"
pdflatex --shell-escape -interaction=nonstopmode "$FILENAME"

AUX_EXTENSIONS=(
  aux bbl blg log out toc fls fdb_latexmk synctex.gz
  lof lot run.xml bcff nav snm vrb
)

AUX_FOLDERS=(
  _minted
)

for EXT in "${AUX_EXTENSIONS[@]}"; do
  FILE="${FILENAMETEXT}.${EXT}"
  if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
    rm "$FILE"
  fi
done

for FOLDER in "${AUX_FOLDERS[@]}"; do
  if [ -d "$FOLDER" ]; then
    rm -rf "$FOLDER"
  fi
done
```
