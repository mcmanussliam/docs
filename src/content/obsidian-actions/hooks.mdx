# Hooks

Hooks determine when your action runs:

| Hook         | Description                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `manual`     | Executes only when manually triggered via the settings or command palette. |
| `startup`    | Executes automatically when Obsidian loads.                                |
| `interval`   | Executes on a schedule using cron syntax, `* * * * *`.                     |
| `createFile` | Executes whenever a new file is created in the vault.                      |
| `modifyFile` | Executes whenever a file is modified.                                      |
| `deleteFile` | Executes whenever a file is deleted.                                       |
| `renameFile` | Executes whenever a file is renamed.                                       |


Interval hooks require a valid cron schedule. See [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/examples.html) for examples.
