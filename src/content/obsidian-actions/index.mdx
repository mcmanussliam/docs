# Overview

**Actions** is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that lets you define custom automation using either JavaScript or shell commands. These actions can be triggered manually, on app startup, on specific file events, or on a schedule.

The plugin is designed to be flexible but safe, exposing a controlled runtime environment along with contextual variables that can be templated into your scripts.

## Why Actions?

A lot of the actions I've created already have plugins exist, the biggest issue I have is that they don't fit my specific use case. This plugin gives you the flexibility to create exactly what you need.

## Features

- **Multiple Trigger Types**: Run actions manually, on startup, on file events, or on a schedule
- **JavaScript & Shell Support**: Write actions in your preferred language
- **Templated Variables**: Access contextual information like file paths, vault location, etc.
- **Safe Runtime**: Controlled execution environment for security
