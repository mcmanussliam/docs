# Command Types

## JavaScript

`js` actions are executed in a controlled environment with access to a subset of the Obsidian API and helper functions, this includes:

- `app`
- `vault`
- `workspace`
- `metadataCache`
- `fileManager`
- `Notice`
- `Modal`
- `Setting`
- `FuzzySuggestModal`
- `exec`

This can allow you to do some really interesting code:

```javascript
new Notice('Hello World!'); // displays a notice in Obsidian
console.log(app.vault.getFiles()); // logs in the Obsidian console
exec('echo "{{path}}"'); // execs a shell command with an environment variable
```

## Shell

`shell` actions execute code in a plain `shell`. It's useful for running scripts, git commands, or other cli tools:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Update"
git push
```
